       "is a bioactive polyphenol and flavonoid that has traditionally been used in \n",
       "Chinese herbal medicine for its robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory \n",
       "properties. It is derived from many plants, including Hovenia dulcis and is \n",
       "found as the active ingredient in a variety of popular hangover remedies. \n",
       "Investigations utilizing DHM have demonstrated its ability to alleviate \n",
       "ethanol-induced disruptions in mitochondrial and lipid metabolism, while \n",

       "METHODS: Female c57BL/6J mice (n = 12/group) were treated using the Lieber \n",
       "DeCarli forced-drinking and ethanol (EtOH) containing liquid diet, for 5 weeks. \n",
       "Mice were randomly divided into three groups: (1) No-EtOH, (2) EtOH [5% (v/v)], \n",
       "and (3) EtOH [5% (v/v)] + DHM (6 mg/mL). Mice were exposed to ethanol for 2 \n",
